# Phishing Awareness Mini-Program (HR & Marketing Focus)

A compact, practical toolkit to help non-technical teams—especially **HR** and **Marketing**—spot and stop phishing. Includes a slide deck outline, a one-page checklist, and a short quiz you can use in onboarding or refresher training.

> Why this repo? HR handles external CVs and sensitive employee data; Marketing works publicly across social platforms and inboxes—both are frequent targets. This kit gives them simple, repeatable steps to reduce risk.

## 🧠 What is Phishing?
Phishing is when an attacker **pretends to be a trusted person or service** to trick you into sharing credentials, payment details, or other sensitive information—often by pushing you to click a link or open an attachment that looks legitimate. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

---

## 🚩 Common Red Flags (Show, Don’t Tell)
- **Manufactured urgency**: “Do this in the next 60 minutes or your account is locked.”
- **Sender mismatch**: Display name looks right, but the **email address** is slightly off.
- **Generic or odd greeting**: “Dear User,” or a greeting that doesn’t fit your context.
- **Language tells**: Typos, awkward phrasing, or unusual sign-offs.
- **Link camouflage**: Text says one thing; the **actual URL** (hover to preview) says another.
- **No (or odd) signature**: Missing standard corporate footer or policy links. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

> Training moment: Have learners hover over links (don’t click) and read the target domain out loud.

## ✅ 60-Second “Spot-the-Phish” Checklist
1. **Pause**: Is the email pushing urgency or fear?
2. **Check the sender**: Does the domain match the real organisation?
3. **Hover links**: Does the previewed URL match the text and your expectations?
4. **Look for context**: Were you expecting this request/attachment?
5. **Ask via a separate channel**: Confirm by Teams/Slack/phone before acting. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## 🛡️ How We Avoid Getting Phished (Team Habits)
- **If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is**—treat unexpected offers with caution.
- **Be healthily suspicious**—better to ask than assume.
- **Verify on a side channel**—never “reply to the same email” to confirm a request.
- **Check website addresses carefully** before logging in or entering any details.
- **Use a password manager** to create and store unique passwords.

5. **What to do next**  
   Verify via side channel, report, don’t click/open, escalate if uncertain. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
6. **Micro-quiz (2 questions)**  
   “Is this safe?” (A/B) + “Which red flag do you see?”

---

## 📝 Reporting Workflow (Template)
When you suspect phishing:
1. **Do not click** links or open attachments.  
2. **Capture evidence**: screenshot + full headers (or use “Report Phish” button if available).  
3. **Report to Security/IT**: attach evidence, include why it looked suspicious.  
4. **Notify stakeholder via another channel** if the email names a real colleague/vendor.

> Add your org’s mailbox/Slack channel here: `security@yourcompany.com` or `#report-phish`.

## 🧪 Quick Quiz (5 Qs)
1) “Your payroll will be paused unless you verify in 30 minutes.” What red flag is this?  
2) The display name matches your CFO, but the domain is `@payroll-co.io`. Safe or phish?  
3) Where do you look to verify a link without clicking it?  
4) Why should you confirm by phone/Teams before processing unusual payments?  
5) Name two things you always check before entering credentials.
