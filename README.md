# 🎯 Phishing Awareness Mini-Program (HR & Marketing Focus)

## 📌 Why HR & Marketing?
In many organisations, HR and Marketing teams are **prime targets for phishing** because:  

- **HR** regularly receives external CVs, job applications, and employee-related documents. Attackers exploit this by sending malicious attachments or links disguised as resumes or HR forms.  
- **Marketing** manages external communication channels, social media accounts, and public-facing brand activities. Attackers often impersonate vendors, clients, or partners to trick them into clicking malicious links or sharing credentials.  

In phishing awareness campaigns, these two departments are often found to be **more susceptible than others**, which makes tailored training essential. This project provides materials designed specifically to address their unique risks and workflows.

## 🧠 What is Phishing?
Phishing is when an attacker **pretends to be a trusted person or service** to trick you into sharing credentials, payment details, or other sensitive information—often by pushing you to click a link or open an attachment that looks legitimate.  

---

## 🚩 Common Red Flags
- **Manufactured urgency**: “Do this in the next 60 minutes or your account is locked.”  
- **Sender mismatch**: Display name looks right, but the **email address** is slightly off.  
- **Generic or odd greeting**: “Dear User,” or a greeting that doesn’t fit your context.  
- **Language tells**: Typos, awkward phrasing, or unusual sign-offs.  
- **Link camouflage**: Text says one thing; the **actual URL** (hover to preview) says another.  
- **No (or odd) signature**: Missing standard corporate footer or policy links.

## ✅ 60-Second “Spot-the-Phish” Checklist
1. **Pause**: Is the email pushing urgency or fear?  
2. **Check the sender**: Does the domain match the real organisation?  
3. **Hover links**: Does the previewed URL match the text and your expectations?  
4. **Look for context**: Were you expecting this request/attachment?  
5. **Ask via a separate channel**: Confirm by Teams/Slack/phone before acting.  

---

## 🛡️ How We Avoid Getting Phished (Team Habits)
- **If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is** — treat unexpected offers with caution.  
- **Be healthily suspicious** — better to ask than assume.  
- **Verify on a side channel** — never “reply to the same email” to confirm a request.  
- **Check website addresses carefully** before logging in or entering any details.  
- **Use a password manager** to create and store unique passwords.

2. **Phishing in one minute**  
   Simple definition + a “how the con works” diagram.  
3. **Red-flag examples**  
   Screenshots with highlights: urgency, sender mismatch, link hover.  
4. **Spot-the-phish checklist**  
   The 5 steps above as large icons.  
5. **What to do next**  
   Verify via side channel, report, don’t click/open, escalate if uncertain.  
6. **Micro-quiz (2 questions)**  
   “Is this safe?” (A/B) + “Which red flag do you see?”  

---

## 📝 Reporting Workflow (Template)
When you suspect phishing:  
1. **Do not click** links or open attachments.  
2. **Capture evidence**: screenshot + full headers (or use “Report Phish” button if available).  
3. **Report to Security/IT**: attach evidence, include why it looked suspicious.  
4. **Notify stakeholder via another channel** if the email names a real colleague/vendor.

## 🧪 Quick Quiz (5 Qs)
1) “Your payroll will be paused unless you verify in 30 minutes.” What red flag is this?  
2) The display name matches your CFO, but the domain is `@payroll-co.io`. Safe or phish?  
3) Where do you look to verify a link without clicking it?  
4) Why should you confirm by phone/Teams before processing unusual payments?  
5) Name two things you always check before entering credentials.
