# 🛡️ Reporting Workflow – Suspected Phishing Email

When you spot a suspicious email, follow this workflow to keep the organisation safe.  

---

## 1. 🚫 Do Not Interact
- Do **not** click on links.  
- Do **not** open attachments.  
- Do **not** reply to the sender.  

---

## 2. 📸 Capture Evidence
- Take a screenshot of the suspicious email.  
- If possible, capture the **full email headers** (shows the real sender details).  
- Note why you believe it’s suspicious (e.g., urgency, odd domain, strange attachment).  

---

## 3. 📤 Report Immediately
- Use the **“Report Phish” button** (if available in Outlook/Email client).  
- Or forward the email to **IT/Security Team** at: `security-team@email.com`.  
- Attach screenshots and include your notes.  

---

## 4. 🔄 Notify Stakeholders (If Named)
If the email mentions a colleague, vendor, or client:  
- Contact them via a **different channel** (Teams, Slack, phone).  
- Confirm whether the request is legitimate.  

---

## 5. ✅ Security Team Response
Once reported, IT/Security will:  
- Quarantine the email.  
- Investigate sender details, attachments, and links.  
- Alert other employees if the phishing attempt was widespread.

📌 **Remember:** Quick reporting helps protect the entire organisation.  
When in doubt — **report first, ask questions later.**
