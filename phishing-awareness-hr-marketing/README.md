## 📌 Why HR & Marketing?
HR and Marketing were identified as the most vulnerable departments during a phishing awareness campaign. I developed a targeted training program for these teams, including a concise slide deck, checklist, and short quiz. This project demonstrates the ability to translate technical threats into clear, actionable training for non-technical staff - a skill essential for reducing human risk in organisations
In many organisations, HR and Marketing teams are **prime targets for phishing** because:  

- **HR** regularly receives external CVs, job applications, and employee-related documents. Attackers exploit this by sending malicious attachments or links disguised as resumes or HR forms.  
- **Marketing** manages external communication channels, social media accounts, and public-facing brand activities. Attackers often impersonate vendors, clients, or partners to trick them into clicking malicious links or sharing credentials.  

In phishing awareness campaigns, these two departments are often found to be **more susceptible than others**, which makes tailored training essential. This project provides materials designed specifically to address their unique risks and workflows.
