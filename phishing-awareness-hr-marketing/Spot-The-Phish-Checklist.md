## 🚩 Red Flags to Watch For
- **Urgency or Fear**: “Do this in 30 minutes or your account will be locked.”  
- **Sender Mismatch**: Display name looks right, but the email address is slightly different.  
- **Generic Greeting**: “Dear User,” instead of your actual name.  
- **Spelling & Grammar Errors**: Typos, awkward phrases, unusual sign-offs.  
- **Link Camouflage**: Hover over the link — does the URL match the text and your expectations?  
- **Odd or Missing Signature**: No corporate footer, missing company details.
