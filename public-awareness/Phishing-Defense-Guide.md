# 🛡️ Phishing Defense Guide (For Everyone)

Phishing is when a bad person pretends to be someone you trust (like your bank, boss, or a friend) to trick you into clicking a link or giving away secrets.  
Here’s how **anyone** can stay safe

## 🚩 5 Easy Rules to Spot a Phish

1. **Don’t Rush ⏰**  
   If a message says “Do this NOW or else!” — stop. Real companies don’t scare you like that.  

2. **Check the Name & Address 👀**  
   “From: Netflix” is not the same as `netfIix-support@mail.ru`.  
   (Look closely — sometimes one letter is wrong!)  

3. **Hover Before You Click 🖱️**  
   Put your mouse over the link — does it really go to the website you expect?  
   Example: `paypal.com` ✅ vs `paypa1-login.co` ❌  

4. **Attachments Can Be Traps 📎**  
   Don’t open weird files from strangers (or even friends, if it feels off).  

5. **When in Doubt, Check it Out 📞**  
   Ask the person directly (call your bank, text your boss, message your friend).  
   Never trust the same email to confirm itself.

📌 *Remember: It’s better to double-check once than to clean up a big mess later.*
