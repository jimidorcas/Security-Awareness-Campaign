# 🔐 Top 5 Cybersecurity Tips Everyone Should Know

Staying safe online doesn’t need to be complicated.  
Here are 5 quick tips you can follow every day:

---

## 1. Use Strong, Unique Passwords 🔑
- Don’t reuse the same password everywhere.  
- Use a password manager to create and remember strong ones.  
- Example: A long passphrase like *“BlueCatsDanceAtMidnight!”* is stronger than `123456`.

---

## 2. Think Before You Click 🖱️
- Hover over links to see where they really go.  
- Don’t click on unexpected attachments or files.  
- If a message feels strange, double-check with the sender.

---

## 3. Keep Your Software Updated 🔄
- Updates fix holes that hackers exploit.  
- Turn on automatic updates for your phone, computer, and apps.  
- Don’t ignore those “update available” pop-ups!

---

## 4. Watch Out for Phishing 🎣
- Phishing emails try to trick you into giving up passwords or money.  
- Red flags: urgent tone, strange sender, suspicious links.  
- If in doubt — report it or confirm via a different channel.

---

## 5. Lock Down Your Accounts 🔒
- Turn on **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** wherever possible.  
- This adds an extra step (like a text code or app approval) so hackers can’t get in even if they steal your password.

📌 *Remember: Cybersecurity is like brushing your teeth — small daily habits make a big difference.*
